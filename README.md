3. Apply multiple filters to each group.
4. Automatically updates output files when their inputs have been changed.
5. Pre-compile assets using `artisan asset:warm`.

## Installation

The recommended way to install is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

Update the project's composer.json file to include Laravel-Assetic:

- Laravel 5: use the 2.\* releases.
- **Laravel 4: use the 1.\* releases**.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "slushie/laravel-assetic": "2.*"
    }
}
```

Then update the project dependencies to include this library:

```bash
composer update slushie/laravel-assetic
```

After installing, add the service provider and optional `Asset` facade in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    'Slushie\LaravelAssetic\LaravelAsseticServiceProvider',
    ...
],
'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Asset' => 'Slushie\LaravelAssetic\Facades\Asset',
    ...
],
```

Once the app's configuration has been updated, publish the package config:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```

Now the laravel-assetic configuration file will be available at:

```
config/laravel-assetic.php
```

Finally, edit the configuration file to define your assets.
You can define multiple groups, each with different filters and assets.

## Groups

Each group defines `assets` and `filters` as inputs, and an `output` file that should be included in your view.

```php
'groups' => [
    'main_js' => [
        'filters' => [
            'js_min',
        ],
        'assets' => [
            'jquery',                       // Named asset defined below
            'assets/js/common/search.js',   // Single file
            'assets/js/coolarize/*js',      // Folder inclusion
        ],
        'output' => 'scripts.js',           // Writable output relative to public_path()
    ],
],,
```

## Filters

Filters are defined within the package configuration file.
They are applied to the supplied asset files.
Use a closure to instantiate filters that may not have default constructor arguments.

```php
'filters' => [
    'css_min'       => 'Assetic\Filter\CssMinFilter',
    'css_import'    => 'Assetic\Filter\CssImportFilter',
    'css_rewrite'   => 'Assetic\Filter\CssRewriteFilter',
    'embed_css'     => 'Assetic\Filter\PhpCssEmbedFilter',
    'less_php'      => 'Assetic\Filter\LessphpFilter',
    'js_min'        => 'Assetic\Filter\JSMinFilter',
    'coffee_script' => 'Assetic\Filter\CoffeeScriptFilter',
    'yui_js' => function () {
        return new Assetic\Filter\Yui\JsCompressorFilter('yui-compressor.jar');
    },
],
```

## Views

Once defined, your groups can then be accessed from within your views using the `Asset` facade.
To link to the `main_js` group, use the `Asset::url()` method as follows:

```html
<script src="<?= Asset::url('main_js'); ?>"></script>
```

This will output the URL to the asset file (in this example, `/scripts.js`).

Options can be set so the asset generated is linked via `https://` or appended with a cache busting key:

```html
<script src="<?= Asset::url('main_js', ['md5' => true, 'secure' => true]); ?>"></script>
```

When the page loaded, Assetic will generate the file, joining all files and running the defined filters.

You can also pre-generate the asset output files via the artisan command:

```bash
php artisan asset:warm
```

Of course, this can be performed as a composer `post-install` command to generate assets at deployment time.
